# CS 3133 Foundations of Computer Science Final Project
## About
The original goal of this project is to be able to supply a Turing machine that accepts a specific language. However, my goal for this project is to have a general framework that can run any Turing machine, with user-defined alphabets and state machines.

### Assignment
Give a Turing machine that gets as input two arbitrary strings *`x`* and *`y`* separated by the special symbol *`#`* and return `1` if and only if *`x`* is a subsequence of *`y`*. You may assume `|`*`x`*`|<=|`*`y`*`|`. Show the sequence of configurations of your machine when given the input `00#100`. For extra credit: implement a program that runs the Turing machine and shows its configurations while computing the answer. Your program should work for arbitrary inputs.
